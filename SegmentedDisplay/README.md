# 7-Segment Display

This was designed to use cheap "WS218x modules" that are each on small round circuit boards. The ones I have are 5volt

Can be printed with 0 "top layers" to save some time and plastic, makes the look more interesting too

Can scale to some degree up or down, or could add more LEDs per segment
